# Changelog

## v0.1.0

Renamed to `ParameterizedTest`, with the accompanying macro `param_test`.
(Why not `parameterized_test`? It's longer, harder to spell, and there are a lot of
other accepted spellings, including "parameterised," "parametrized," and "parametrised.")

## v0.0.1

Initial release.
